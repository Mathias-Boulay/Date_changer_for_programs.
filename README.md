# Date_changer_for_programs.
This little .bat file is a workaround for certains programs that refuse to execute when a certain date is reached.

You just need to change the TARGETED_YEAR and the TARGET_DIRECTORY lines to get started.

# Known issues:
- The script's name MUST be without spaces or any kind of special characters.
- If there is already an instance of the targeted program, it may not work (eg. Notepad ++).
